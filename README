Neurogenesis provides a simple GUI that can be used to evolve recurrent neural networks that model multiple dimensional time series with long-term dependencies.

The network model is a derivative of the so-called Long Short-Term Memory networks. These networks are grown, complexified, concurrently.

Dependencies include: Scalala, Jung, JFreeChart...

Not yet fully functional or bugfree.
